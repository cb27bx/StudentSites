            <h1>Introducing...Chris Bernard</h1>

            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Chris Bernard and I am a senior in my last semester at Saint Francis College. I graduated from Archbishop Stepinac High School in White Plains. I have mostly overcome all of my injuries that have hampered my persona life during these last few years so I am really optimistic about my future. It has not been an easy journey for me, but it is finally coming to an end.
                I am from the Bronx and I am pursuing in a career in Information Technology. I have worked a ton of part time jobs but my most memorable experience was working as a Pall Bearer. 
                I am currently training for an amateur boxing fight in April.
            </p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>- I greatly enjoy my hobbies and I believe they add a great amount of pleasure and confidence in my life. I am a big sports fan and love watching almost every type of sport. Unfortunately my Knicks and Islanders are not doing so well. Fortunately for me my most favorite team, the New York Mets, are just about to start their new season. I just want to see them finish a year without losing their best players to injuries!</p>
              <p>- I absolutely love to play video games because they have been a part of my life since I was a child. They have given me, my friends, and my siblings a ton of joy throughout the years and is something we can easily talk about for hours.</p> 
              <p> - Another two of my favorite hobbies go together like peanut butter & jelly. Reading and Relaxing after a hard day of training or a long day of school gives me my energy back as well as a certain peace of mind. Those few moments throughout the week where I can just lay down and read a book and take a nap are crucial for me to continue being productive throughout the week.Right now, my favorite do to relax and take a nap to is when I watch nature documentaries like Planet Earth. I love seeing all the beutiful locations and creatures that exist on our planet. The narrator has a very relaxed tone so after I watch a few minutes I get really relaxed and am able to take effective naps. I would recommend this show for anyone that is interested in nature, animals, or just like to have background noises when they sleep!  </p>
